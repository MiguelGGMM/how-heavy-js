# how-heavy-js
 This app prints a tree of libraries indicating the weight of each one in mb and % of total

 Use --min-percentage=2 to indicate the min % of weigth required to be shown on the library tree

 Hobby project because I was not happy with current projects to calculate libraries cost, next step gonna \
 show peer dependency between packages

 This is still not published, use npm link to install the command, then you can use "howHeavy" on any project
