# how-heavy-js
 This app prints a tree of libraries indicating the weight of each one in mb and % of total

 Use --p=2 to indicate the min % of weigth required to be shown on the library tree

 Hobby project because I was not happy with current projects to calculate libraries cost

 Peer deps added

 Run 'npm install -g howHeavy', then you can use "howHeavy" on any project
